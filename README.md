> Discord bot for anonymous text/image posting, with moderation.

Node.js bot to make text/image channels anonymous. Each poster will be given a UUID for identification, which cannot be tied to a user. Posts are anonymised for images after fully loaded; text is instant.

## Installation

OS X & Linux:
In a directory containing all js files.
```sh
sudo apt install nodejs
sudo apt install npm 
npm install discord.js
node bot.js
```

Windows:

Follow the Windows equivalent of Linux installation. 

## Usage

1. Create a local file `login_token`, and provide a login key for the bot
2. Edit state.js to contain the dicord usernames of moderators.
3. Start bot, and add to channel by typing `%add`.
4. Mods can ban using `%ban UUID`, where UUID is a user or image id to be banned.
